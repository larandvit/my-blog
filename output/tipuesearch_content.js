It's my contribution back to the community of technology gurus who helped me be where I am now. I haven't done anything special. I've just learnt information from different sources, validated, refined, added my research, and published back. I appreciate everybody who makes information open and available to public. We are growing together helping each other. The second goal is to create my personal repository as a quick way to refresh my memory in case of forgetting something. In many cases, we are doing a lot of staff but we can't keep it in our heads. When we need it again, we try to reinvent the wheel because we can't recall what it was done before. The last goal is to express myself. This is when I can be creative without any limits. It's my way to go and I'm happy to be successful. If you want to contact me, please drop me a line here .

It might not be an issue if you are going to utilize databases/drivers which included in the standard configuration. But let's imagine case when you need to connect to Hive with Kerberos authentication. This task request advanced skills and time for troubleshooting in case of encountering any issues. Setup The following sample based on Cloudera Hive JDBC driver v. 2.6.5.1007 and DBeaver EE v. 6.3.0 64 bit or DBeaver CE v. 7.0.0 64 bit edition. Download Windows 64 bit (zip) DBeaver installation and unzip it, for example, to C: drive. Your root folder is C:\\dbeaver-ce-7.0.0-win32.win32.x86_64 . Download and unzip Cloudera Hive JDBC driver.

You can figure out how make them from Connect DBeaver to Cloudera Hive with JAAS Configuration using Kerberos Authentication in Windows article. 1) dbeaver.ini 2) jaas.conf 3) krb5.ini 4) organization-service-account.keytab Create dbeaver.vbs file and placed in C:\\dbeaver-ce-7.0.0-win32.win32.x86_64 DBeaver root folder as well. This file is a DBeaver launcher and our goal is to redirect DBeaver workspace from Windows User Home folder to DBeaver root one. We could create Windows batch file but it would show Command Prompt window during DBeaver start. Set WshShell = CreateObject ( \"WScript.Shell\" ) WshShell . Run \"dbeaver.exe -data ./DBeaverData/workspace6\" , 0 Set WshShell = Nothing Run DBeaver with dbeaver.vbs launcher and create a Hive driver and a new Hive connection as per Connect DBeaver to Cloudera Hive with JAAS Configuration using Kerberos Authentication in Windows article.

If DBeaver has been set up in a network folder, it will be one limitation. You need to use mapped driver to run DBeaver, for example, Y:\\myuser\\desktop\\dbeaver-ce-7.0.0-win32.win32.x86_64 .

Hive driver is part of DBeaver installation but it uses basic authentication with user name and password. Kerberos authentication is another option to connect to Hive. It can be accomplished by adding a new driver to DBeaver. The DBeaver driver is based on Cloudera JDBC Driver for Hive and JAAS configuration file. Legend Before going forward, let's get agreed with the initial information used in configuration files. You can easily replace it with configurations applicable to your cases. It will be a kind of a template. Windows user name: mywindowsuser. Hive name host: hivehost. Kerberos realm if your organization supports multiple regions: REGION.SAMPLE.COM. Hive port: 10000. Prerequisites Kerberos configuration file: krb5.conf. The file can be taken from any of Hive nodes. The file is located in, for example, CentOS, /etc folder. One of the files below. It depends on which method is chosen. a) Kerberos credential cache: krb5cc_mywindowsuser. This file contains your Windows kerberized credentials. Using this file will request to renew it. b) Kerberos keytab file: mywindowsuser.keytab. This file stores your Windows kerberized credentials. It doesn't request renewal. Setup The following sample based on DBeaver EE v. 6.3.0 64 bit and Cloudera Hive JDBC driver v. 2.6.5.1007 . Download and unzip Cloudera Hive JDBC driver. Place the unzipped folder to the permanent location. DBeaver reads it from that location every time when the driver is used. It's advisable to read the driver documentation from ./hive_jdbc_2.6.5.1007/docs folder. Registering the Driver Class section tells the class name used in DBeaver driver setup and Using Kerberos section explains each parameter utilized in the driver setup. Append those 4 lines to dbeaver.ini file. The location of the ini file can be different. If you have installed DBeaver, it will be in C:\\Program Files\\DBeaverEE folder. If you use zipped installation, it will be a root folder where it has been unzipped. -Djavax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly = false -Dsun.security.krb5.debug = true -Djava.security.krb5.conf = C:/Users/mywindowsuser/DBeaver/krb5.ini -Djava.security.auth.login.config = C:/Users/mywindowsuser/DBeaver/jaas.conf It's very critical to use correct path separator.

It should be created a custom function to complete this task. Regular Expressions are a good option to deal with manipulation of text data. Microsoft Access and Excel are lacking of support of regular expressions but they allow to utilize third party libraries. A library of our interest is Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5 one. Open your Microsoft Access database or Excel spreadsheet, then go to VBA Editor pressing Alt-F11 combination. Microsoft Access Microsoft Excel Create a new module calling context menu on the root node of the project tree. Microsoft Access Microsoft Excel Copy and paste the function below to the new created module. Function ExtractNumber ( textValue ) Dim re As Object Set re = CreateObject ( \"vbscript.RegExp\" ) re . Pattern = \"[&#94;\\d]\" re . Global = True ExtractNumber = re . Replace ( textValue , \"\" ) End Function This code uses late binding to the library. This method is not preferable but it reduces number of steps to implement the solution. Close VBA Editor. Create a table and a query in Microsoft Access and a column of values in Microsoft Excel to test the function.
