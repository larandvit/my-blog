Z370 and Z390 Intel chipsets was released back in 2017 and 2018 years and they still are mainstream now. There are many motherboards based on Z370 and Z390 chipsets containing 2 or more M.2 sockets. Those motherboards might accommodate NVMe SSD storages with Raid 0 or 1 built on IntelÂ® Rapid Storage Technology.

[ASRock Z370 Pro4](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z370%20Pro4/index.asp) and [ASUS Prime Z390-A](https://www.asus.com/ca-en/Motherboards/PRIME-Z390-A/) motherboards are used in the article to build Raid 1 on [WD Blue SN550 1TB](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-blue-nvme-ssd) NVMe SSDs.

Those two motherboards and WD Blue SN550 NVMe work unstable in Raid configuration. It seems the chipsets are not aimed to be used in Raid with NVMe SSDs. After installing Windows 10, both motherboards are constantly doing two steps: rebuilding Raid and crashing Windows. ASRock support was communicated and a new motherboard was RMAed. ASUS motherboard states that NVMe Raid can be created with addition of ASUS Hyper M.2 X16 Card V2 adapter.

There are 2 ways to fix it. The first way is to use ASUS Hyper M.2 X16 Card V2 adapter. It is only applicable to ASUS motherboard as ASRock motherboard is lack of bifurcation. The second way is to make your motherboard cooler running CPU and motherboard fans on 80% or more of their capacity.

After the Raid setup completed, Windows 10 can be installed. Windows 10 does not request any additional drivers as BIOS handles everything transparently.
